This town, located on the steep hillside of Cleopatra Hill, gained the reputation of 'Wickedest Town in the West'. Jeromes hospital, the United Verde Hospital, was quite busy during its tenure. Having seen over 9,000 deaths, it had also survived the Great Depression, as well as a rebuild from a mine blast in 1926. But with gold and copper desposits dwindling, coupled with a high death rate, only 50 people remained when the building was finally abandoned in 1950. It lied full of equipment for 20 years until it was emptied. But it sat again for another 20 years before it was restored and turned into the Jerome Grand Hotel. Today, talks of ghosts are quite famous in Jerome. Hotel guests have talked of shadow figures and a friendly feline that may scratch at the doors, and there is some over lying sense of sadness and trauma. Some people have even been touched, when no one is around.",
